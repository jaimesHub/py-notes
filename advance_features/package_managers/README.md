# Package Managers

## What
- Package managers allow you to `manage` the `dependencies` (external code written by you or someone else) that your project needs to work correctly.

- `PyPI` and `Pip` are the most common contenders but here are some other options available as well:
    - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) : Manages dependencies via isolation
    - [PIPX](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) : Isolation-based app deployment, so you donâ€™t have to affect the system or user PIP libraries. It enables you to try individual python CLI tools without affecting other dependencies
