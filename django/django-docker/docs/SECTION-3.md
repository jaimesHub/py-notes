# Section 3: Test Driven Development

## What is Test Driven Development ?
- Unit Tests: A “unit test” is a piece of code that tests another specific unit of code
    - Code which tests code
        - Sets up conditions / inputs
        - Runs a piece of code
        - Checks outputs with `assertions`
    - Many benefits
        - Ensures code runs as expected
        - Catches bugs
        - Improves reliability
        - Provides confidence
    -> Good test coverage
- What is TDD ?: A software development practice
    - Development practice
        - Write Test -> Write Code
- TDD Process
    - Write Test -> Run Test (Fails) -> Add feature -> Run Test (Passes) -> Re-factor

                                                            --------------------       
    - You define your new feature by writing a test, which will drive the development of the feature.      
- Why use TDD ?
    - Better understanding of code
    - Make changes with confidence
    - Reduces bugs
