- `Everyone get bugs.`
- [Example](https://replit.com/@appbrewery/day-13-start)
- Steps
    - Describe the Problem
        - Example 1: `my_function`
            - What is the for-loop doing?
            - When is the function meant to print `"You got it"`?
            - What are your assumptions about `i`?

    - Reproduce the Bug
        - Try run your function 'til you get errors
        - Try reproduce these errors
        - Example 2: `dice_imgs`

    - Play Computer

    - Fix The Errors
        - Read clues provided from editors or outputs from terminal by running programs
        - Then googling provided clues to find solutions
    
    - Print is your friend

        - doing evaluation them

    - Use a Debugger

    - Take a Break

    - Ask a Friend
        - A real human
        - Googling
    
    - Run Often
        - Don't wait until you've written loads and loads of code to hit run
        - then find out you've got loads of snags and loads of bugs
        - `Run it after every little execution or change a little code`
