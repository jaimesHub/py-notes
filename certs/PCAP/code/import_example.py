Let's assume that you want to use two entities provided by the math module:

    - a symbol (constant) representing a precise (as precise as possible using double floating-point arithmetic) value of Ï€ (although using a Greek letter to name a variable is fully possible in Python, the symbol is named pi - it's a more convenient solution, especially for that part of the world which neither has nor is going to use a Greek keyboard)
    - a function named sin() (the computer equivalent of the mathematical sine function)

The clause contains:

    - the import keyword;
    - `the name of the module` which is subject to import.
