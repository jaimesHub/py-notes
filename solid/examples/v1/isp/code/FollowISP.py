# Those classes from now on follow the Interface Segregation Principle
# Instead of having one abstract class for all employees, we divided them by
# roles and the child class uses multiple inheritance.
# If you donâ€™t know what multiple inheritance is, the Chef class has multiple
# inheritance as it has two parent classes. Chef class inherits the lead method
# from the Leader class and the cook method from the Cook class.
